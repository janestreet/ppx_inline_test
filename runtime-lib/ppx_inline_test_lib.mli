(** The tests to run are configured by command line arguments, normally pulled from
    [Sys.argv].  Calling [init] will re-configure the test runner using the passed-in
    argument list.  This is useful to run tests in a dynamically loaded library; this
    should be called with the appropriate configuration before loading the library.

    [init] will normally return None.  It will return an error if there's a formatting
    error in the arguments, and will return Some string if help was requested. It will
    also return an error if the test runner has already initialized, either by reading
    command-line arguments or by a previous call to [init].
