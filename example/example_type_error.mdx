At time of writing, using doc comments on a test module results in an error telling the
user to remove the comment.

```ocaml
(* Non-doc comment *)

(** wow *)
module%test _ = struct
  let%expect_test _ = return ()
end
```
```mdx-error
Line 3, characters 3-13:
Error: Attributes not allowed here
```
